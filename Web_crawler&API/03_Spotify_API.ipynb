        "Spotify is one of the most popular music streaming platform in the world. There are millions of songs available in the platform. There is Spotify for Developers which is a platform providing API for developer to make connection to Spotify.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are various APIs in the platform. In this tutorial, we will briefly discuss how we can use Spotify Web API. Spotify Web API enables the creation of applications that can interact with Spotify's streaming service, such as retrieving content metadata, getting recommendations, creating and managing playlists, or controlling playback. Here we will mainly focus on how we can retrieve data from Spotify using Web API.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before using Spotify API, please check the documentation from Spotify here: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api. A good understanding of the API and the endpoints can help you successfully retrieve data from API.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we are writing scripts ourselves and make connection to Spotify API directly. But in the real-world practice, we might need to do this because other people might have already build a Python wrapper (package/library) which is ready to use and it could be easier to use. For Spotify, there is one Python library called `Spotipy` (https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.22.1/) that you can use. Spotipy is a lightweight Python library for the Spotify Web API. With Spotipy you get full access to all of the music data provided by the Spotify platform.\n",
        "\n",
        "But here for learning purpose, we will perform all the steps ourselves, so you will have a good understanding of how API works, especially how REST API works."

There are many types of API authentication, such as HTTP basic authentication, API key authentication, JWT, and OAuth.Please check [this link](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/api-authentication/) from Postman which explains very well what API authentication is and the main types of authentication.\n",

You can just visit https://open.spotify.com/ and search for the artist you would like get information. Click on the three dots icon from the artist profile. Click three dot icon and select Share > Copy link to artist. The Spotify ID is the value that comes right after the open.spotify.com/artist URI. In this example, I am checking Taylor Swift and the link I got is https://open.spotify.com/artist/06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02, so \"06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02\" is the artist Spotify ID.
